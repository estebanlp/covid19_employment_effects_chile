Repository with codes and data for replication of paper: "COVID-19 and employment relief programs: A tale of spatially blind policies for a spatially driven pandemic"

Please open the file "00_Master.Rmd" for full explanation on the data construction and estimation of main tables. 

Giving space restrictions, all employment data has been provided in a dropbox link that you should be able to download and use freely. If you encounter any problems, please create an issue in this repository and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
